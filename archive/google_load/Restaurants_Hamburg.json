These positives however do not outweigh the room quality. The rooms were  unacceptable in my opinion (and I do not have high expectations when it comes to accommodation). I was not concerned by how dated the room was (the carpets and furniture are very old and heavily stained which may deter some people), but the smell, heat and noise are what I found to be unacceptable.\n\nSmell - upon arrival I assumed I had been given a smoking room by mistake as the smell was so overwhelmingly pungent. I went back to reception and was advised that there are no smoking rooms. There was no remediation possible, each night of my stay I had to go to the hotel, open the window, and leave for an hour to allow the smell to dissipate; it by no means eradicated it, but it was at least manageable. Looking around the room there is signage requesting customers not to empty their ash tray into the waste paper bin so my assumption of the smell is that the carpets \/ furnishings have not been changed since the time when it was a smoking room and the smell has lingered ever since.\n\nHeat - the hotel is not air conditioned or sufficiently ventilated. They provided a desktop fan which I was able to put on the coffee table to circulate air but it merely circulated hot air and I repeatedly woke up covered in sweat.\n\nNoise - this would not have been an issue if the heat was not so bad, but the heat meant I had to open the window, and the outside noise from opening the window was significant. My room was not facing the central station as others have commented however the noise levels were still high, particularly in the early morning.\n\nOverall, I had minimal sleep during my 3 nights here which is far from ideal for a business trip. I would encourage visitors to stay in one of the many other hotels in the city as I have not had the issues above with any other hotel in Hamburg.","time":1532676784}],"6":[{"author_name":"Sarah Bowler","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/111288306376497245695\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/-7NVwIbQrl_w\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAL8\/qX77ohqONf0\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2\/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Stayed for 4 nights.\nVery happy with the room, good size, clean, all amenities needed.\nSpa downstairs has a pool, jacuzzi and sauna, robes and slippers are from reception. \nHotel is in a good location to access the whole city by foot.","time":1540504628},{"author_name":"B K","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/100500130981128495205\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/-RQL7J4vNkjI\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/AGDgw-ghnXVnBJvYmf6DrGNeVPbLteS1UQ\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Fantastic location, great newly decorated rooms and service is very attentive!

Upon arrival we were pretty shocked how unclean our two rooms (a single and a double) were. We counted several spiders with webs and the staff tried to explain this by saying that even with regular cleaning they would keep coming inside cause the hotel is surrounded by nature (I didn't see any more spiders though for the next 4 days after the room was cleaned properly). My bed frame cover had a clearly visible blood stain on it and in my colleague's room it smelled like someone had emptied a whole bottle of cheap room freshener. After having spoken to the manager, she gathered her cleaning staff, and in front of us they were discussing who was to blame for this. It was highly unprofessional from the manager's side and telling your staff off in front of your guests is an absolute no go. I only had a tiny handtowel in my bathroom and after asking if I could get a bigger one I was told that they were a bit short of the big ones the day my room was made ready. I was too astounded to react to this very curious excuse. Anyway my friends were offered another room which was a better standard and my room was thoroughly cleaned which made a big difference and we got the first night for free as an apology.\n\nUnfortunately this wasn't quite the end of the story. The hotel was booked as an official exhibition hotel and when we got back from the first day at the fair (which ends at 11pm) the bar was already closed. One can only wonder why you as a business would close your bar so soon when you are fully aware that 90 percent of your guests will only return around midnight. The next day we returned from the exhibition hungry and wanted to eat at the restaurant. On their homepage it clearly states that the kitchen is preparing food until 10pm. We were there 9.30pm and the receptionist told us that the kitchen would always close at 8.30pm. She made us feel like we were the idiots who didn't know that and she wouldn't even apologise after we read her the info from their own homepage.\u00a0\n\nAll in all one can say that we experienced a curious stay and witnessed some poorly business choices which might cost this hotel the next official exhibition booking.","time":1543098972},{"author_name":"ABDULRAHMAN ALHUMUD","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/109919700772136283142\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/-M_WIa2mMkuA\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAABRY\/n5zuC7OmirI\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6\/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Good and Quiet, wifi high speed gym free, thx for everything","time":1540368341},{"author_name":"Alexander Gro\u00df","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/111697872605247107918\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/-eDSANJjrrWw\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAW_M\/v6pGCfZSWjs\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist sehr einfallslos und es gibt kaum frisches.
