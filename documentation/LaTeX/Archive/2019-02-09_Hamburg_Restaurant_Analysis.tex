\section{Transparency Portal Hamburg}
As the first German federal state, Hamburg enacted a transparency law on October 6, 2012 \cite{Murjahn.2016}. Opposed to a right to request information, which all citizens had until this date, a new duty to inform the public was laid upon the stateâ€™s administration offices. All information that would fall under this law, now had to to be published in a freely available standard format on a centered storage of information. The single pieces of information, which would fall under the law, varied highly in precision and the comprehensive term of ``geodata'' was requested opposed to precise datasets of geodata. A legal interpretation was worked out for all requested points and a plan for the release of geodata was designed consisting of the basic data for measurement admistration and the technical geodata for special administration offices. The transparency law granted a period of two years for the technical implementation.

In October 2014, the ``Transparency Portal'' (http://transparenz.hamburg.de/) as the major component of the implementation of the transparency law was released \cite{Murjahn.2016}. With this portal, the Hamburg citizens have a multitude of data and documents available that was prior only available to Hamburg's administration. One important focus was the release of geodata that was even before the law in preparation for an ``Open GeoData'' model. In this ``Open GeoData'' model, geodata was split into two groups of data sets, one group extractable with little effort, but free to the public and expected with a high use, and another group with expected high demand and high revenue on the sale of this data. For this second group of datasets, more effort with new measurements had to be arranged. With the transparency law in place, all datasets were merged into the Transparency Portal and yielded a much higher download count than the count of dataset sales before the portal was active. The Transparency Portal uses a standardized meta data repository called the \ac{metaver} in collaboration with other German federal states.

\section{Hamburg District Map}

Since usually cities raise important figures in aggregation per admistrative area, in Hamburg being the single city districts, these administrative areas should be imported into QGIS to be able to link single restaurants to an administrative area and hence figures that could be important as dependent variables to predict restaurant success. The borders administrative areas are taken from a dataset  of the Transparency Portal called ``ALKIS Verwaltungsgrenzen Hamburg'' \cite{LandesbetriebGeoinformationundVermessung.28.02.2018}. This dataset is available in multiple dataformats, is reported to have a 0\% data deficit and a precision of 0.1 meters. It is part of the \ac{alkis}, a digital combination of the real estate book information and a real estate map \cite{ALKIS2019}.
